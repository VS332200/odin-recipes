    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Red sauce pasta is a delicious recipe of pasta and mixed veggies in a homemade tangy</p>
    <p>and bright tomato sauce. Make this pasta with or without veggies and they taste good</p>
    <p>every time. I like to add veggies as they give a good taste and also increase the </p>
    <p>nutrition factor. This red sauce pasta is especially good for kids who like pasta but</p>
    <p>refuse to eat vegetables.</p>
